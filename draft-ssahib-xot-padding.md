{{I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls}} specifies use of TLS to prevent zone content collection via passive monitoring of zone transfers. This document lists considerations for various padding policies and provides recommendations.

# Padding for AXoT

As mentioned in {{I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls}}, the goal of padding AXoT responses would be two fold:

- to obfuscate the actual size of the transferred zone to minimize information leakage about the entire contents of the zone.
- to obfuscate the incremental changes to the zone between SOA updates to minimize information leakage about zone update activity and growth.


A simplistic option, following the premise of the Block-Length Padding strategy recommended in [RFC8467], would be to specify

a 'message size' to which each individual AXFR response would always be padded (with a maximum value of 65353 bytes) and
a compatible 'zone block size' for a zone to which the sum total of all the AXFR responses should be padded. This could equivalently be specified as a 'zone number of AXFR responses block size'.
Primary implementations SHOULD provide a configurable block-size based padding mechanism.

This second requirement is likely to require an implementation to create 'empty' AXFR responses in order to pad a zone to the zone block size. That is, AXFR responses that contain no RRs apart from the EDNS(0) option for padding. However, as will existing AXFR, the last message sent MUST contain the same SOA that was in the first message of the AXFR response series in order to signal the conclusion of the zone transfer.

[RFC5936] says:

"Each AXFR response message SHOULD contain a sufficient number of RRs
to reasonably amortize the per-message overhead, up to the largest
number that will fit within a DNS message (taking the required
content of the other sections into account, as described below)."
'Empty' AXoT responses generated in order to meet a padding requirement are exempt from the above statement. Secondary implementations MUST be resilient to receiving padded AXFR responses including 'empty' AXFR response that contain only padding.

Observation of the zone transfers would then reveal only zone block size step changes in the total zone size (if the zone size changed sufficiently) obfuscating the smaller fluctuations.

Choosing a message size of less than 65535 only really makes sense for small zones that can be transferred in a single response (in which case the zone block size can be set to the same value). Choosing a zone block size close to the current zone size would provide some protection with a minimal overhead. Choosing a zone block size much larger than the current zone size would provide increased protection but with increased overhead.

As with any padding strategy the trade-off between increased bandwidth and processing due to the larger size and number of padded DNS messages and the corresponding gain in confidentiality must be carefully considered.

As noted in [RFC8467], the maximum message length, as dictated by the protocol, limits the space for EDNS(0) options. Since padding will reduce the message space available to other EDNS(0) options, the "Padding" option MUST be the last EDNS(0) option applied before a DNS message is sent. In particular for AXFR, that means that if the message is to be signed with, e.g., TSIG this must be done before the padding is applied.



# Padding for IXoT

As mentioned in {{I-D.draft-ietf-dprive-xfr-over-tls}}, the goal of padding IXoT responses is to minimize leakage about zone update activity through the size and timing of responses.

The frequency of IXFR is affected by if and how the zone is DNSSEC signed. For example, both the following zones might see frequent similarly sized IXFR exchanges

* a small DNSSEC signed zone with frequent record updates
* a large DNSSEC signed zone that receives no updates but the RRSIG signature
  expiry dates are jittered across the signature lifetime window

A simplistic option, following the premise of the Block-Length Padding strategy
recommended in [@RFC8467], would be to specify

* a 'message block size' where each individual IXFR response would always be
  padded to the closest multiple of that number of bytes (with a maximum value
  of 65353 bytes)

Choosing a message block size of less than 65535 will expose some information about zone activity but obfuscate the more granular changes.

As with any padding strategy the trade-off between increased bandwidth and processing due to the larger size and number of padded DNS messages and the corresponding gain in confidentiality must be carefully considered. For IXFR a detailed understanding of the zone contents and transfer pattern is likely to be required in order to select the optimal block size for a zone.

Primary implementations SHOULD provide a configurable message block size based padding mechanism. As noted in [@RFC8467], the maximum message length, as dictated by the protocol,
limits the space for EDNS(0) options. Since padding will reduce the message space available to other EDNS(0) options, the "Padding" option MUST be the last EDNS(0) option applied before a DNS message is sent. In particular for AXFR, that means that if the message is to be signed with, e.g., TSIG this must be done before the padding is applied.
